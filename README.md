# SpeedLight Cache
Ultra speed server side cache, fast solution for speeding your homepage

This cache is aimed to be a simple and effective mechanism for reducing the TTFB. This is accomplished by taking the back end factor out of the equation, but visitor-server latency and server load will affect this metric, too.

## SPEED MATTERS

Because Time to First Byte (TTFB) is the only speed parameter proven to affect a site's search rank, as opposed to page loading time, the attention spent on it it's well worth.

Additionally site speed improves user experience, it has been stated that just “a one second delay can cost you 7 percent of sales.”

Other important actions that you should take are: minimize http requests (combine stylesheet, image sprites), compress (gzip, optimized jpeg), balance (CDN)
